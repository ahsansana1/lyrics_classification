I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)
'Cause they only want to know you, and roll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think its so sad

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try them best to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try them best to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try them best to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled u betta recognize
They not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me 'cause I know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity
