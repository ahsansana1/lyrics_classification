Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt,
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece,
Sorrow decrease
Pressure release, I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt (Yes)
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances are given, question existing

Take off my coat,
Show them that under here,
I'm just like you, do the mistakes,
I may make me a fool or a human with flaws,
Admit that I'm lost
Round of applause,
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether "win or lose"

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?

Dear Diary,
It's Robyn
Entertain is something I do for a living
It's not who I am, I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal,
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt,
I think guys suck sometimes,
But when you're in the spotlight,
Everything seems good,
Sometimes I feel like I have it worse 'cause I have to always keep my guard up,
I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am,
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am,

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
