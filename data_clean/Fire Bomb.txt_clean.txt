Yeah woah

Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm going
I gotta get where I'm going, take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm going I don't need my brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road-oh-oh, oh oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow-oh-oh, oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire so I won't have
To burn alone, then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold but baby no it doesn't have to be
Microwaving a metal tragedy
Watching it burning, it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful when it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast baby
That's the thing

Where I'm going I don't need my brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road-oh-oh, oh oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow-oh-oh, oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire so I won't have
To burn alone, then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Baby we were killin' em
They couldn't handle the millionth, degree
We were criminals
'Cause we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing

The lovers need to clear the road-oh-oh, oh oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow-oh-oh, oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire so I won't have
To burn alone, then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
(Oh oh oh)
Fire bomb
