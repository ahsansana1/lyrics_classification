No matter what



It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good

No matter what I do, I'm no good without you



Must be love on the brain

That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way)

Must be love on the brain

That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way)

Must be love, must be love

Mu-mu-must be love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love



No matter what



It beats me black and blue but it fucks me so good

No matter what I do, I'm no good without you



Must be love on the brain

That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way)

Must be love on the brain

That's got me feeling this way (feeling this way)

Must be love, must be love

Mu-mu-must be love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
