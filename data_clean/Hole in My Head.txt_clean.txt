Let's go



You got a hole in your head

You got a hole in your head, girl



You got a hole in your head

You got a hole in your head, girl



You got a hole in your head

You got a hole in your head, girl



Not use, your lips keep movin' but I got a couple screws loose

Them other boys talkin' about me they say I'm bad news ?

And probably best for you to keep this short

Its my time to interrupt, to start me up



I don't think you wanna do that right now

And not with me (with me), don't start with me (with me)

I got (i got) a gun on me

I don't think you really wanna run your mouth

Cause how I feelin' what it down

You'll burn it down



All over your radio, see me in the stadium

I'll spin your body, let these ladies know

Around me

Don't push my buttons

You don't really wanna see me get fired up ?

G-g-g-get wild



I got a hole in my head

A hole in my head

Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody

Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said

I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

Dont look at me funny

Like you ain't hear what I said

I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay



Parking lot, I ride this like a fast car

Suck it up, don't even try to act hard

And you can try to run but you won,t get very far

And you can try to hide but I know where you are



Let loose, I see right through you

You got a hole in your head too

And I knew it but I let 

So I hope you got your swagger up

You know just what I love

Really take a lot to work me up



I don't think you wanna do that right now

And not with me (with me), don't start with me (with me)

I got (i got) a attitude on me

I don't think you really wanna run your mouth

Cause how I feelin' what it down



Catch me on your mind baby

Don't waste my time baby

Now watch me wind

You can take that as a sign baby

So left and right with me

So push my buttons

You see me get wild

Go go wild baby



I got a hole in my head

A hole in my head

Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody

Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said

I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay ay

Don't look at me funny

Like you ain't hear what I said

I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay



(oh ooh)

Sometimes I go crazy

(oh ooh)

Watch me Watch me

(oh ooh)

Sometimes I go crazy



Break it down

I hear voices in my head they go

Break it down

I hear voices in my head they go



I got a hole in my head

A hole in my head

Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody

Don't look at me funny

Did you hear what I said

I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

Dont look at me funny

Like you aint heard what I said

I gotta hole in my head

Ay ay ay



You got a hole in your head

You got a hole in your head, girl

You got a hole in your head

You got a hole in your head, girl
