You are missing that kissing when we're over

Boy what I'm feeling never feel it about another

I need you, why can't you come over

And you my lover, but I love you like a brother

Baby don't want at the end of the day

You are who you are and I love you that way

Lasting love, if you know the difference

You had a little game on ya, caught up in your feelings

We together like, oh



You know that I'mma do whatever I'm not gon' leave

This kind of love don't come easy

We don't care what they think, babe

Promise we'll stay the same

Say that you stay right here for me



See I know you like being round chicks

And looking at hips, and a little outfit

What can I say

That's what I love about you babe

Yeah don't mess, cause I know you gon' lie

You way too sexy, to ever be shy

Middle of the day give me what I want

It feels so special, it feels so good

And he ain't going no where even if he could

You know what I'm talking about bout

Make a nigga scream and shout, shout

Every time my legs go out, out

You know that I'mma do whatever I'm not gon' leave

This kind of love don't come easy
