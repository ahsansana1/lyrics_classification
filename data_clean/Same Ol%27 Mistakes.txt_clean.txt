I can just hear them now

"How could you let us down?"

But they don't know what I found

Or see it from this way around

Feeling it overtake

All that I used to hate

Worried 'bout every trait

I tried but it's way too late

All the signs I don't read

Two sides of me can't agree

When I breathe in too deep

Going with what I always longed for



Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)

I don’t care I’m in love (stop before it’s too late)

Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)

I finally know what is love (you don’t have what it takes)

(Stop before it’s not too late)

(I know there’s too much at stake)

(Making the same mistakes)

And I still don’t know why it’s happening

(Stop while it’s not too late) And I still don’t know



Finally taking flight

I know you don't think it's right

I know that you think it's fake

Maybe fake's what I like

Point is I have the right

I'm thinking in black and white

Thinking it's worth the fight

Soon to be out of sight

Knowing it all this time

Going with what I always longed for



Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)

I don’t care I’m in love (stop before it’s too late)

Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)

I finally know what is love (you don’t have what it takes)

(Stop before it’s too late)



Man, I know that it is hard to digest

But maybe this story ain’t so different from the rest

And I know it seems wrong to accept

But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

And I know that it's hard to digest

A realization is as good as a guess

And I know it seems wrong to accept

But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets



Feel like a brand new person

So how will I know that it's right?

In a new direction

So how will I know I've gone too far?

Stop thinking you're the only option (feel like a brand new person)

I finally know what it's like

Stop thinking you're the only option, oh (in a new direction)

So how will I know I've gone too far?

Stop thinking you're the only option (feel like a brand new person)

And I don't know how to describe



(Stop before it’s too late)

Stop thinking you're the only option

(But you make the same old mistakes)

(You don’t have what it takes)

(Stop before it’s too late)

Stop thinking you're the only option



(But you make the same old mistakes)

I finally know what it's like (stop before it’s too late)

Stop thinking you're the only option

Stop thinking you're the only option
