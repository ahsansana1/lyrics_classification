Here we lay face to face once again

Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend

And I'm wondering who will be to first to say what we both know

We're just holding on to could-have-beens and we should be letting go



It feels like you're a million miles away 

As your lying here with me tonight

I can't even find the words to say

Say I can find a way to make it right

And we both know that the story's ending

We play the part but

We're just pretending and I can't hide the tears

'Cause even though you're here

It feels like you're a million

Miles away



Was it me, or was it you that broke away? 

For what we were is like a season love is change and every

Time I think about it, it tears me up inside. 

Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.



It feels like you're a million miles away 

As your lying here with me tonight

I can't even find the words to say

Say I can find a way to make it right

And we both know that the story's ending

We play the part but

We're just pretending and I can't hide the tears

'Cause even though you're here

It feels like you're a million

Miles away



We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before

While our song is playing its last note we

Both know for sure that it's time to close that door



It feels like you're a million miles away 

As your lying here with me tonight

I can't even find the words to say

Say I can find a way to make it right

And we both know that the story's ending

We play the part but

We're just pretending and I can't hide the tears

'Cause even though you're here

It feels like you're a million

Miles away
