I got the hotness (hotness, hotness, hotness)

I got the hotness (hotness)

Rihanna



Baby you can call me

Anytime you want me

Hotness loving you is all I need

Boy we can get it cracking

Song text you can make it happen

Come and get the best of me

Song text baby watch me & step up

You don't want to mess up

Lyrics baby it'd be cool if we could see

'cause baby (baby) you got (you got) the fires that I remedy



It's too hot

You don't have to stick around baby

Liedertexte you got

Something I been thinkin' about lately

Don't stop

Liedertext spitting up the game to send me crazy

You know how to get it babe, baby come and get it babe

Boy if you want this, baby you should talk to me

Song text



Baby we can ride out

Go somewhere and hide out

Lyrics far away from everything

We ain't gotta tell nobody

We can just get it poppin'

Lyric baby come be next to me

Baby what you got

Can't nobody take it, no

Liedertexte it's on loud

Baby you know you can get it

Liedertext so baby (baby) take me (take me) 

To a place where we can be alone
