I got a house but I need new furniture
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?
The truth is, I will love you the same
But why complain, you buying Gucci, babe?

You might see me in the spot, ya boy think I'm hot
So I came up in here to get what you got
I'm hot like the block, uh huh, you like that
Know you wanna bite that, uh huh, yeah, right there

They love the young girl, they wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick and I ain't talking movies
If ya young, if ya hot, girl, shake what ya got, girl
I keep 'em singing

Lemme get that, huh
What you got, up in them jeans?
Put it on me or get lonely
Lemme get that, huh?
You know five car garages
Name on your bank account, all day massages

Lemme hit that, huh
I wanna put it on blast
Lemme get that, huh?
Better slow down 'fore I make you crash, boy
Got what you want, baby, got what you need
But we can't proceed unless you got that for me

I got a house but I need new furniture
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?
The truth is, I will love you the same
But why complain, you buying Gucci, babe?

I'mma put you on the spot, keep the sheet in knots
I bought me a Benz, you buy me the yacht
A girl need a lot, the girl need some stocks
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got

They love the young girl, they wanna give it to me
Wish I was in a flick and I ain't talking movies
If ya young, if ya hot, girl, shake what ya got, girl
I keep 'em singing

Lemme get that, huh
What you got, up in them jeans?
Put it on me or get lonely

Boy, I know you want my love, love
Nothing is free in this world, world
Unless my love is your love, love
I'm not a gold digger
