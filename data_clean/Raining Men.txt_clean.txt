If you want to let him go

Ladies don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so, we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so, we ain't running out
Oh it's raining men girl what you worry 'bout?

Who you think you getting with that high let me freak ya
You got me mistaken thinking you gon get it easy

Think you getting something baby, you ain't getting none
All you need to know that I'm a two times five
Load it, cock it, aim it baby, boom bye bye
Set your standards lower boy you're aiming too high
Matter of fact your friend looks better so (Huh) good bye
