Story of my life 

Searching for the right 

But it keeps avoiding me 

Sorrow in my soul



Cause it seems that wrong

Really loves my company 

He's more than a man 

And this is more than love 



The reason that the sky is blue 

The clouds are rollin' in 

Because I'm gone again 

And to him I just can't be true 



And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful 

And it kills him inside 

To know that I am happy with some other guy 

I can see him dying 



[Chorus]

I don't want to do this anymore 

I don't want to be the reason why 

Every time I walk out the door 

I see him die a little more inside 

I don't want to hurt him anymore 

I don't want to take away his life 

I don't want to be a murderer 



I feel it in the air 

As I'm doin' my hair 

Preparing for another date

A kiss upon my cheek 



As he reluctantly 

Asks if I'm gonna be out late 

I say "I won't be long. 

Just hangin' with the girls." 

A lie I didn't have to tell 



Because we both know 

Where I'm about to go 

And we know it very well 



Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful 

And it kills him inside 

To know that I am happy with some other guy 

I can see him dying 



[Chorus]



Our love 

His trust 

I might as well take a gun and put it to his head 

Get it over with 



I don't want to do this 

Anymore 

Whoa-oh 

Anymore



[Chorus]



A murderer 



No, no, no, yeah, yeah
