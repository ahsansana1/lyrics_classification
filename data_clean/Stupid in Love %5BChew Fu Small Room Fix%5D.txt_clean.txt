Hmm stupid in love

Oh, stupid in love, hmm



Let me tell you something

Never, have I ever 

Been a size ten in my whole life

I left the engine running

I just came to see

What you would do if I

Gave you a chance to make things right

So I made it, even though Katy

Told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time

And she was right, hmm

Don't understand it blood on your hands

And still you insist on repeatedly trying

To tell me lies

And I just don't know why, oh



This is stupid, I'm not stupid

Don't talk to me like I'm stupid

I still love you, but I just can't do this

I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid



My new nickname is "You Idiot" (such an idiot)

Hmm that's what my friends are calling me when

They see me yelling into my phone

They're telling me let go

He is not the one

I thought I saw your potential

Guess that's what made me dumb

He don't want it, not like you want it

Scheming and cheating oh girl

Why do you waste your time?

You know he ain't right

You telling me this, I don't wanna listen

But you insist on repeatedly trying

To tell me lies

And I just don't know why



This is stupid, I'm not stupid

Don't talk to me like I'm stupid

I still love you, but I just can't do this

I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid



Trying to make this work

But you act like a jerk

Silly of me to keep holding on (oh)

But the dunce cap is off

You don't know what you've lost

And you won't realize

Till I'm gone, gone, gone

That I was the one

Which one of us is really dumb



Oh ooh

No

No

No, I'm not stupid in love



This is stupid, I'm not stupid

Don't talk to me like I'm stupid

I still love you, but I just can't do this

I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid



I may be dumb but

I'm not stupid in love
