He been gone since 3.30 (3.30)

Been coming home lately at 3.30 (3.30)

I'm super cool, I've been a fool

But now I'm hot and baby you're gonna get it

Now I ain't trippin', I, I ain't twisted

I ain't demented, well just a little bit (huh)

I'm kicking ass, I'm taking names

I'm on a flame, don't come home babe



I'm breakin' dishes up in here

All night (uh huh)

I ain't gonna stop until I see police lights (uh huh)

I'm a fight a man (tonight)

A man, on a m-a-a-a-aan

A man, a man, on a m-a-a-a-aan

Oh



I'm still waiting, come through the door

I'm killing time and I'm bleaching ya clothes

I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire

And what I'm burning, is your attire

I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested

And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in

Is he cheating? Man I don't know

I'm looking round for something else to throw



I'm breakin' dishes up in here

All night (uh huh)

I ain't gonna stop until I see police lights (uh huh)

Blow this, Blow this, huh
