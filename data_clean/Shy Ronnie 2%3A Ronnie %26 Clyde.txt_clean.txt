Yeah, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

We at it again, everybody now

Hands in the air, it's a stick up, stick up

No funny business or you get lit up, lit up

You test I (I), you gon' die (die)

And at your funeral ya mama gon' cry

So customers kiss the floor, floor

And clerks open cash drawers slow, slow

If you don't wanna end up dead

You'll do everything Shy Ronnie says

Tell 'em, Ronnie!



No one in the bank can hear you

Shy Ronnie, use your outside voice

We don't have time for this

Let's go



So stay on the ground it's a stick up, stick up

Your wallets and jewels we'll pick up, pick up

Unload the cash (cash), move your ass (ass)

We getting' money, tell 'em Shy Ronnie





Please, please use your words

Just imagine that everyone's naked

Uh, oh!

Boner alert. He really pictured them naked.

The police are on their way

(Come out with your hands up)

Good luck, Shy Ronnie

Bye, bye!



Haa!



Ronnie motherfucker and I'm back from the dead,

Brain bored with the murder, so I shot my own leg

Don't get the name twisted, cause I'm crazy as shit

I hung a giant ass noose off my giant ass dick



Aye! I forgot this money

And also this guy

Come on, we're gonna have sex

Too-da-loo!



And you can hang from it

Cause you don't wanna see my real gun

Shots to the sky but your face sound real fun!

Ronnie!
