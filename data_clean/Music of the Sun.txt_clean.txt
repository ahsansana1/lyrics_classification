Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

Listen closely hear the music playing
Let it take you to places far away
And relax your senses just do what you want to do
No need for questions
Its only for you

And it's so amazing
Oh how you can't escape it
The movement takes you
And never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles its alright
Let them go til' we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (the sun yeah)

So real
So right
Can't explain the feeling
Like the sunlight brings to life new meaning
No need for stress, (no need for stress)
Save that for another day
No second guessing
Just trust me when I say

And it's so amazing
Oh how you can't escape it
The movement takes you
And never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there
(Let the rhythm take you there)
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles its alright
Let them go til' we see the morning light (see the morning light)
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun
(Come and dance to the music of the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (of the sun yeah)

And it's so amazing
Oh how you can't escape it
The movement takes you
And never let's you go!

Can't you feel the music in the air
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles its alright (its alright, it's alright)
Let them go til' we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Let it take you far away
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Let it take you far away
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Come and dance to the music of the sun

Can't you feel the music in the air
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
