Turn your face towards the sun

Let the shadows fall behind you

Don't look back, just carry on

And the shadows will never find you



Turn your face towards the sun

Let the shadows fall behind you

Don't look back, just carry on

And the shadows will never find you



Lost in the rock and roll

Got lost in a promise of a love I never know

Shadows chase me far from home

I remember when my heart was filled with gold

And you know I've been burned

I've been burned I've been burned

You've seen me lose control

It's not worth it's not worth it's not worth

My soul



Turn your face towards the sun

Let the shadows fall behind you

Don't look back, just carry on

And the shadows will never find you



Lost my faith and trust

You and I know gold don't turn to rust

I still swear that we can reign

Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays

Don't you know I've been burned

I've been burned I've been burned

You've seen me lose control

It's not worth it's not worth it's not worth

My soul



Turn your face towards the sun

Let the shadows fall behind you

Don't look back, just carry on

And the shadows will never find you



Where you gonna go where you gonna go where you gonna run to

When you get to the edge of the night

Its time you face the sky



Turn your face towards the sun

Let the shadows fall behind you

Don't look back, just carry on

And the shadows will never find you



Turn your face towards the sun

Let the shadows fall behind you

Don't look back, just carry on

And the shadows will never find you



Turn your face towards the sun

Let the shadows fall behind you
