Baby slow down, just here me out

There's something I gotta let you know

No need to push, no need to rush

You know you had me from hello



When it comes to my heart I don't play

Baby boy can't you see the stop sign

You're movin' much too fast

Baby love doesn't grow in a day

Let's get it right the first time

Make this feeling last



Baby if you're willing to wait

We can just take our time (Take our time)

Don't you know that it's getting late

And I know what's on your mind

I know this feeling is crazy

It's mutual baby

But we don't have to rush something real

Baby if you're willing to wait

We can just take our time (Take our time)



Boy can't you see I'm not tryna be

The girl who gets taken for a ride

You take your time and you will find

There's so much more to me inside

And you say there's no need to delay

You're telling me to trust you

Boy, you know I want to baby

But my heart can so easily break

Before we take this very far show me who you really are



Baby if you're willing to wait

We can just take our time (Take our time)

Don't you know that it's getting late

And I know what's on your mind

I know this feeling is crazy

It's mutual baby

But we don't have to rush something real

Baby if you're willing to wait

We can just take our time (Take our time)



Baby love doesn't grow in a day

Let's get it right the first time

And make this feeling last



Baby if you're willing to wait

We can just take our time (Take our time)

Don't you know that it's getting late

And I know what's on your mind

I know this feeling is crazy

It's mutual baby

But we don't have to rush something real

Baby if you're willing to wait

We can just take our time (Take our time)
