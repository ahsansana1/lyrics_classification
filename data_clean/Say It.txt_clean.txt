Emotions running wild
I could feel it when I'm next to you
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay but won't tell me
It's about of secrecy
So what are you tryin' to hide?
I know what the look means
You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door
I can tell you can't take no more
Blow your secret open wide

So baby, if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy
Maybe you can spend the night
If you say it
But if you playin' (Oh baby)
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (Hear)
Say it, that'll make it more clear (Clear)
I need to know how you feel
So, baby, won't you (Say it), say it, (Say it), say it?

Won't, won't you tell me what, what's going on?
Why, why you waitin' on it, what you waiting for?
Soon you should tell me or I might be gone
But I'm here for you, baby, you should put me on

I won't shoot you down
Make you feel some kinda way
If you'll be honest with me
Put away your pride
I can see it in your face
You want me permanently (Uh)
Like how I whine when we dancing
I know how it happened
And I'm right there wit' you
But I won't be the first to put myself out there
The feeling is mutual
But I bet if you

So baby if you say it (Say it)
Tell me what it is you like (Like)
Baby, baby, don't be shy (Shy)

If you say it

Say it, that'll make it more clear (Clear)
I need to know how you feel
So, baby, won't you (Say it), say it (Say it) say it?

Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryin' to fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest?
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryin' to fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together
So won't, won't you tell me
And get it off your chest?
