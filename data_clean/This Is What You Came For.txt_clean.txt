Baby, this is what you came for

Lightning strikes every time she moves

And everybody's watching her

But she's looking at you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh

Oh, oh



Baby, this is what you came for

Lightning strikes every time she moves

And everybody's watching her

But she's looking at you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh

Oh, oh



You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

Oh, oh



We go fast till they can't replay

Who knows why it's gotta be this way

We say nothing more than we need

I say "your place" when we leave



Baby, this is what you came for

Lightning strikes every time she moves

And everybody's watching her

But she's looking at you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh

Oh, oh



You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

Oh, oh



Baby, this is what you came for

Lightning strikes every time she moves

Yeah



Baby, this is what you came for

Lightning strikes every time she moves

And everybody's watching her

But she's looking at you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh

Oh, oh



You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

Oh, oh
