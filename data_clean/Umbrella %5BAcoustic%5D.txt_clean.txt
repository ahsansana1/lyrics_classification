You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart

Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star

Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars



And that's when you need me there

With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together

Told you I'll be here forever



Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever



Know that we'll still have each other

You can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

Under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

These fancy things will never come in between

You're part of my entity, here for infinity

When the war has took its part



When the world has dealt its cards

If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together

Told you I'll be here forever



Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever

Know that we'll still have each other

You can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

Under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

Under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

Under my umbrella



(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

You can run into my arms

It's okay, don't be alarmed, come in to me

There's no distance in between our love



So go on and let the rain pour

I'll be all you need and more

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together

Told you I'll be here forever



Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever

Know that we'll still have each other

You can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

Under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

Under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)

Under my umbrella

(Ella ella, ay ay ay)
