Desperado

Sitting in a old Monte Carlo

A man whose heart is hollow uh

Take it easy

I’m not tryna go against you

Actually, I’m going with you



Gotta get up out of here and 

You ain’t leaving me behind

I know you won't, 'cause we share common interests you 

Need me, there ain’t no leaving me behind

Never know, no, just want out of here yeah

Once I'm gone, ain’t no going back



If you want

Take a peek and run away, running from 

And it’s out of luck

Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing

There ain’t nothing here for me

There ain’t nothing here for me anymore

But I don’t wanna be alone



(Oh)

(Oh)

(Oh)



Desperado

Sitting in an old Monte Carlo

We've both had our hearts broken

Take it easy

I'm not trying to go against you

I can be a lone wolf fishing



Gotta get up out of here 

And you ain’t leaving me behind

I know you won't, 'cause we share common interests you

Need me, there ain’t no leaving me behind

Never know, no, both flying out of here yeah

Once we're gone, ain’t no going back



If you want

We could be runaways, running from 

And it’s out of luck

Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing

There ain’t nothing here for me

There ain’t nothing here for me anymore

I don’t wanna be alone



Dear desperado

Yeah I don’t wanna be alone

Dear desperado

Yeah I don’t wanna be alone



If you want

We could be runaways, running from 

And it’s out of luck

Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing

There ain’t nothing here for me

There ain’t nothing here for me anymore

But I don’t wanna be alone



If you want

We could be runaways, running from 

And it’s out of luck

Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing

There ain’t nothing here for me

There ain’t nothing here for me anymore

But I don’t wanna be alone



Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
