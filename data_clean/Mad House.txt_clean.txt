Ladies and gentlemen
To those among you who are easily frightened
We suggest you turn away now
To those of you who think they can take it
We say, welcome to the mad house!

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh
(Mad house)

Na nana nana nana
Nana, nana, nana, nana
Come on, come on, come on in
Come on, come on in
Mad house

Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh
Welcome to the mad house

Na nana nana nana
Nana, nana, nana, nana
Come on, come on, come on in
Come on, come on in
