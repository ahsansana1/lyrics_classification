I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss I sent it off, and just said this ""I know exactly what I want this year Santa, can you hear me?"" I want my baby, baby I want someone to love me Someone to hold Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe) You'll be all my own in a big red bow Santa, can you hear me? I have been so good this year And all I want is one thing Tell me my true love is near He's all I want, just for me Underneath my Christmas tree I'll be waiting here Santa, that's my only wish this year (Oh yeah, yeah) Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep Would I be wrong, for taking a peek? 'Cause I heard that you're comin' to town Santa, can you hear me? I really hope that you're on your way With something special for me in your sleigh Oh please, make my wish come true Santa, can you hear me? I want my baby, baby I want someone to love me Someone to hold Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe) We'll be all alone under the mistletoe Santa, can you hear me? I have been so good this year And all I want is one thing Tell me my true love is near He's all I want, just for me Underneath my Christmas tree I'll be waiting here Santa, that's my only wish this year I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah Bring me a love, I can call all mine, oh yeah 'Cause I have been so good, so good this year Can't be alone, under the mistletoe He's all I want and a big red bow Santa, can you hear me? I have been so good this year And all I want is one thing (yeah, yeah, yeah) Tell me my true love is near He's all I want, just for me Underneath my Christmas tree I'll be waiting here Santa, that's my only wish this year Oh Santa, can you hear me? Oh Santa Well, he's all I want, just for me Underneath my Christmas tree I'll be waiting here Santa, that's my only wish this year Santa, that's my only wish this year"

I expect you do, so why haven't you? Maybe you're not even human cause Only an angel can be so unusual Sweet surprise, I could get used to Unusual You Can't believe that I almost didn't try When you call my name Now everything has changed Baby you're so unusual Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart? I expect you do, so why haven't you? Maybe you're not even human cause Only an angel can be so unusual Sweet surprise, I could get used to Unusual You"
